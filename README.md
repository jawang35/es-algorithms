# Data Structures and Algorithms in Modern JavaScript
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jawang35/es-algorithms.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jawang35/es-algorithms)

This is a collection of data structures and algorithms written using modern ES6/7 JavaScript syntax. Eventually I might write up explanations for each of these data structures and algorithms, but until then [Swift Algorithm Club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club) is a great resource for learning these fundamental computer science concepts.
