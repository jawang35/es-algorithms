This is a collection of data structures and algorithms written using modern ES6/7 JavaScript syntax. Eventually I might write up explanations for each of these data structures and algorithms, but until then [Swift Algorithm Club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club) is a great resource for learning these fundamental computer science concepts.

## Requirements
Unit tests should run and pass on the latest LTS and current versions of Node.js.
