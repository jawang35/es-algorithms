# Data Structures and Algorithms in Modern JavaScript

This is a collection of data structures and algorithms naively implemented in modern ES6/7 JavaScript. Eventually I might write up explanations for these fundamental computer science concepts, but until then [Swift Algorithm Club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club) is a great resource.

## Requirements
Unit tests should run and pass on the latest LTS and current versions of Node.js.
